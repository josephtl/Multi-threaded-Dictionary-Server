# Shared_Dictionary

This program is to design and implement a multi-threaded server using sockets for network communication. The server should allow concurrent clients to search for the meaning(s) of a word, add a new word, and remove an existing word. The objective is to demonstrate the use of sockets and threads as the lowest level of abstraction for network communication and concurrency.
